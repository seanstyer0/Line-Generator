# Line Generator

--Note-- This was a final project for the last of my introductory Java courses. The final project built upon previous homeworks and in-class exercizes.

--Summary-- This project parses coordinate data from a .txt file and generates a best fit line for the data set. The driver (testgeneration.java) generates a set number of random equations and compares their fitness values to present the best fit line. These equations are stored in trees, and each equation is randomly generated with each node consisting of a constant or an arithmatic operator. This continues until a specified maximum tree depth is reached or all of the external nodes are constants. This implementation allowed me to strengthen understanding of the four basic principles of object-oriented programming.
